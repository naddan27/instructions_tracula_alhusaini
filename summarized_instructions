### CONFIGURATION INFO ###
The scans with 2 DWI scans were preprocessed using B0 inhomogeneity distortion. Those with one were not corrected.

echospacing = ""Effective Echo Spacing (s) = 1/(BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode * MatrixSizePhase)"
effective echo spacing was not used, just echo spacing = 1/BW
bandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode is a DICOM tag: 0x0019,0x1028, BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode
MatrixSizePhase is the number of columns in the data as the phase direction in RL or LR; the DICOM tag was used: 0x0028,0x0011, columns

epifactor is  "Total number of lines in k-space in the 'y' direction collected during acquisition."
The DICOM tag was used: 0x0018,0x0089, Number of Phase Encoding Steps
